# Simple History Architecture Overview

Simple History follows a modular and service-based architecture pattern that makes it easy to extend and maintain. This document provides a high-level overview of how the plugin is structured and how its components interact.

## Core Architecture

The plugin is built around several key concepts:

### 1. Event Logging System

The core of Simple History is its event logging system, which consists of:

- **Loggers**: Classes that handle logging specific types of events
- **Events**: Individual log entries with associated metadata
- **Contexts**: Additional data associated with events
- **Initiators**: Sources that triggered the events (users, WordPress core, other plugins, etc.)

### 2. Service-Based Architecture

The plugin uses a service-based architecture where different functionalities are split into services:

```php
Simple_History\Services\
├── Setup_Database        // Handles database setup and migrations
├── Dropin_Handler        // Manages plugin drop-ins
├── Logger_Interface      // Interface for all loggers
├── API                   // REST API functionality
└── Settings             // Plugin settings management
```

### 3. Plugin Components

The main components of Simple History include:

1. **Core Plugin Class** (`Simple_History`)
   - Initializes the plugin
   - Loads services and loggers
   - Manages plugin lifecycle

2. **Logger System**
   - Base logger class
   - Specialized loggers for different types of events
   - Logger registration and management

3. **Database Layer**
   - Events table
   - Contexts table
   - Query optimization

4. **User Interface**
   - Admin pages
   - Dashboard widget
   - Log viewer
   - Settings pages

## Data Flow

1. **Event Logging**:
   ```
   Action occurs → Logger captures event → Event stored in database with context
   ```

2. **Event Retrieval**:
   ```
   User request → Query database → Format events → Display in UI
   ```

## Extension Points

Simple History can be extended through:

1. **Custom Loggers**
   - Create new loggers for specific events
   - Extend existing loggers

2. **Drop-ins**
   - Add new functionality
   - Modify existing features

3. **Filters and Actions**
   - Modify log data
   - Add custom functionality
   - Change UI elements

## Performance Considerations

The plugin is designed with performance in mind:

- Efficient database queries
- Lazy loading of components
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Pagination of log entries
- Optimized database schema

## Security

Security measures include:

- Capability checks for viewing logs
- Data sanitization and validation
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Protection against unauthorized access
